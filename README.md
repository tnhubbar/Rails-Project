This app will allow you to create your own personalized Workout Routines and categorize and filter them by category and duration. Upon starting you will have the option to sign up with your own personalized username and password, or log in as an already existing user via the login or through Facebook. You can create a Workout Routine and assign it to a category and add exercises to it, as well as give it a duration. After entering all of the details it will be saved in the user's database and they can come in and revisit their routines, edit their routines, or delete their routines.  The Routine is an object, the categories are objects, and the exercises are objects.
